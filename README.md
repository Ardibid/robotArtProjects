# Robotic Art Projects

List of the project in the [RobotArt competition](https://robotart.org/).

## Robot Paintings
 - **e-David**, Electronic Drawing Apparatus for Vivid Interactive Display:
 -a robotic procedural painting process ![e-David](https://robotart.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/final_01.jpg)
They establish a visual control loop using a camera that captures the output of the machine. New drawing commands are computed based on the difference between what is on the canvas and what we want to have on the canvas.

Pendar uses a style transfer technique to generate the image and then draw them with a DIY robot. [more details needed here]
 - **AARON**

[video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPhYuL6E6qo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPhYuL6E6qo))
Developed by [Hod Lipson](http://www.hodlipson.com/) Pix18 is a gantry CNC that uses a brushes and a pallete of colors to paint. [more details needed]

## Drawing with ML
-**Neural Painters**: A learned differentiable constraint for generating brushstroke paintings [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08410.pdf) / [Github](https://github.com/reiinakano/neural-painters)
