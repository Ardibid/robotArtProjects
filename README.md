# Robotic Art Projects

List of the project in the [RobotArt competition](https://robotart.org/).

## Robot Paintings
 - **e-David**, Electronic Drawing Apparatus for Vivid Interactive Display:
 -a robotic procedural painting process ![e-David](http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/eDavid/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/final_01-1024x777.jpg)
They establish a visual control loop using a camera that captures the output of the machine. New drawing commands are computed based on the difference between what is on the canvas and what we want to have on the canvas.

Pendar uses a style transfer technique to generate the image and then draw them with a DIY robot. [more details needed here]
 - **AARON**

Harold Cohen was one of the earlies pioneers of painting with robot. (needs more details here)

 - **Pix18**:

Developed by [Hod Lipson](http://www.hodlipson.com/) Pix18 is a gantry plotter that uses a brushes and a pallete of colors to paint. [more details needed]
This project went through several stages, from a small robotic arm to a large gantry plotter. The earlies version was using a robotic arm to draw, a brushstroke simulation and a GA to optimize the difference between the drawing and the input image. But later versions have been using more advanced AI and a better drawing system, most interestingly is the way the user uses the palette to fine tune the results.
